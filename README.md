# Caesar-Vigenere-Cipher
Project to implement basic cryptographic ciphers

This a school project to implement a Casear and Vignere Cipher. Here are the requirements:

This lab is worth 40 points. Here is how I'm apportioning those points:

A fully functioning Caesar Cipher: 35 points

    Broken down as follows:

          Reads in user plaintext : 5

          Reads in user key shift: 5

          Outputs encoded message: 15

          Can handle both upper case and lower case letters: 5

         Gives user the option to decode (undo the shift): 5

To get full credit you must also include a program that:

Attempts the Vigenère Cipher: 5 points

This will get you the full 40 points for this lab

Extra Credit:

Fully Functioning Vigenère Cipher:  10 bonus points

     To get the extra credit, this program must 1) read in user plaintext, 2) read in user's key phrase (this is COMPUTERSCIENCEISAWESOME in the lab example, but it should work no matter what the user inputs),  and 3) output the encoded message.
